A typical day for me during my freshman year was structured like this:
  <br>
</p>
      <ul>
        <li>9:30 am - Go to school</li>
        <li>4:00 pm - Get home</li>
        <li>4:30 pm - Do homework for an hour</li>
        <li>6:00 pm - Eat dinner</li>
        <li>6:30 pm - Play video games</li>
        <li>10:00 pm - Sleep</li>
<p>
There wasn't much to it other than that. It was simple, but I was content, and that's all that mattered to me.
</p>
<p>
Things changed when my good friend Ahasan convinced me to join the football team. I had never played a team sport besides participating in a little kids' weekend soccer league. I had no idea what I had committed to. It was a rude awakening. I went from having no responsibilities, worries, and challenges to having no time. Sure, school was mentally challenging, but it wasn't exhausting. It didn't limit me from doing the other things I enjoyed as football did.

Suddenly a typical day for me turned into:
  <br>
</p>
         <ul>
        <li>8:00 am - Go to school</li>
        <li>3:30 pm - Football practice</li>
        <li>7:15 pm - Get home and lay down on the floor for 20 minutes while questioning my life choices before showering</li>
        <li>8:00 pm - Eat dinner, do homework, study</li>
        <li>11:00 pm - Sleep</li>

<p>
I went from having too much time on my hands to having none. I stuck with it, but I didn't know why or how. I didn't realize it then, but I was developing some serious discipline.
<br><br>
(To put it simply) I learned to do things I didn't want to do.
<br><br><br><br>
"Who cares if you miss a practice." Is something I would hear a lot. "It's just a high school sport," and I had no intention of playing college football. "It's all a waste of time since it'll mean nothing once you graduate."
<br><br>
But to me, It was much deeper than just missing a practice. It was breaking my routine. It was a lack of discipline. Sure, there were weeks when I felt highly motivated, and all I could think about was football. But at the end of the day, discipline dragged me to morning practice even when I didn't want to go, not motivation.
<br><br><br><br>
This discipline began to translate into everything I did.
<br><br>
Skip the extra credit assignment and get some sleep.
<br><br>
Skip the gym today; you can use some rest.
<br><br>
I don't feel like getting out of bed to take my supplements; it's whatever.
<br><br>
I began to see myself grow out of this dangerous mindset. The little things add up, and making it routine to skip things will only allow for it to become a habit.
<br><br>
So, I started doing the things I didn't want to do. I left my comfort zone. I did the stupid extra credit assignment. I showed up to the gym. I swallowed the nasty supplements that had me on the verge of vomiting every time I took them.
<br><br>
And I regret nothing. It's clich√© but I wouldn't be the person I am now without it.
<br><br><br><br>
What I want you to take away from this is:
           </p>
           <h2>Challenge yourself.</h2><p>
To the people around my age reading this (teenagers), start holding yourself accountable. As you transition from young adulthood into adulthood, no mom, dad, or teacher will hold your hand or tell you exactly what to do; it is up to you to become the person you want to be.
</p>
