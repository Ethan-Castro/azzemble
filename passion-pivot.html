Some feel they’ve found the passion they want to dedicate their life to.
<br><br>
Others feel they’re dedicating their life to finding their passion.
<br><br>
Whether you’re the first or second, I just want to touch on the probability/possibility/permissibility of pivoting your passion.
<br><br>
I am young, so of course, one day I love math, another I love philosophy, another I want to become the greatest grappler ever to walk the earth; whatever it may be that day, there are usually a select few that stay consistent.
<br><br>
For me, I love lifting weights & philosophy. Everything else is ever so changing.
<br><br>
To add on, there are some things you passionately dislike. For me, that was Coding.
<br><br>
It went against my identity. It was logic-based intelligence that I was bad at.
<br><br>
But I am so good at math. That is who I am. How could I be bad at this?
<br><br>
Trying it out made me rethink who I was. Maybe I wasn’t really that smart. So many other people were amazing at it and I couldn’t even get past the first line of code.
<br><br>
So, I manually and automatically decided to dislike it passionately.
<br><br>
So much so that I started hating math and loving reading. A complete flip from the first 15 years of my life.
<br><br>
SO MUCH SO, that I went from near failing English state test scores and near-perfect math state test scores to barely passing Trig and writing a book.
<br><br>
Fast forward getting rejected from college and getting pulled back from my stay in dreamland — where I could just write and talk about philosophy all day long and become ever so wealthy by people just enjoying whatever words I regurgitated from greater minds that came before me — I now (in conversation with my parents) have pivoted to Data Science and Programming.
<br><br>
For the first few weeks, it SUCKED.
<br><br>
I almost gave up every day. I felt dumb. I legit could not grasp what I was being taught.
<br><br>
But I spent hours looking for the semi-colon I missed, re-reading and re-reading, and going on separate websites to find methods of doing things; it’s all starting to click.
<br><br>
I am actually starting to love it.
<br><br>
I am gaining a necessary skill, a valuable skill, and most rewardingly, I am doing something that I thought I couldn’t do, something that made me feel incompetent when I first started.
<br><br>
Not only am I gaining a new passion, but I did not lose my previous passions, nor the lessons that were learned from obsessing over those passions.
<br><br>
Maybe if I became passionate about these blogs, they’d be halfway decent.
