Life is pretty dull for the most part.
<br><br>
  We hear it all the time
  <br><br>
  “Don’t compare yourself to others on social media; they just post their highlights.”
  <br><br>
  Though, dull does not equate to meaningless. It just means every minute is not a cheap thrill.
</p>
              <h4>One distraction I am slowly learning more about and being more intrigued by is mastery and the pursuit thereof.</h4>
<p>
As you‘ve probably read me write about a million times, I am learning new things. When you learn new things, you look at recent news, how it originated, and all of the greats in the field.
  <br><br>
  In Jiu Jitsu, a BJJ player named Gordon Ryan is the best right now (and said to be the best ever). It’s very inspiring (almost drug-like) to watch the greats, especially when they recently performed.
<br><br>
  In the computer science/machine learning space, Elon Musk & Lex Fridman are some big names. The cool thing about them is they are very active on social media, which gives me a glimpse into their current thoughts + actions, I’ve frequently been watching them since I was very young, and they pose as factors for why I am branching into this.
</p>
<p>
Mastery and greatness provide incredible entertainment.
  <br><br>
  Being in awe of someone’s greatness is a great feeling.
  <br><br>
  You aren’t thinking
  <br><br>
Wow, they put in some hard work & sacrificed to be in that position
              <br><br>
  You are thinking: 

Nice Catch/Wow, they’re rich/They can teach anything to anyone/They can program a freaking rocket/I can’t put down their book/Their song is stuck in my head.
          <br><br>
  Or it’s so good you don’t think; you just watch with your jaw on the floor.


              
              </p>
<p>
Sometimes life is boring, and you are just living for the weekend to watch football, or maybe for a concert you have coming up, or perhaps you are going to a restaurant with your friends, and you’re just living, looking forward to something.
   <br><br>
  You are living, waiting for the external to alter your internal. (Drug-like)
     <br><br>
  That in itself can become slightly dangerous because the moment you don’t have something to look forward to, the mundaneness of everything reveals itself, and you come to realize you had some pent-up dread, which can turn to nihilism, blah blah blah.
     <br><br>
  Here is where the pursuit of mastery comes in.
     <br><br>
  Learning to love the process/journey of becoming great is a positive feedback loop.
     <br><br>
  You work towards bettering yourself at something ->
     <br><br>
  You get better at something ->
     <br><br>
  You love getting better at something-> (step 1)
     <br><br>
  This cycle can keep you occupied for just about your whole life, for there is always room to get better.
  
</p>
<p>
It is not easy. Learning to love the process and the seeming external stagnation that accompanies it (in the beginning) is not an easy thing to love or even tolerate.
   <br><br>
In my case, I didn’t suddenly fall head over heels in love with studying for hours upon hours. I didn’t magically grow in love with trying something over and over for 5 hours, waiting for it to work (almost the definition of insanity). I put focused + intentional effort into working towards this point of perception (I will speak on how I did this in another piece).


</p>
<p>
“It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable”
<br>
Socrates
  <br><br>
  I’d say this quote carries infinitely more weight in the cognitive sense.
  <br><br>
  You are taking away from the collective by not being everything you can be. You have solutions, ideas, theories, that can change everything, that can make people’s lives more bearable, but you wouldn’t know unless you tried.
</p>
<p>
Why wouldn’t you want to be great? You can.
  <br><br>
Why wouldn’t you try? Many of you are in a position where you can take at least some mini-risks to pursue some greatness.
  <br><br>
Whether it be:
  <br><br>
Getting up a little earlier than you want to start something.
  <br><br>
Staying up later than you’d like to finish something. (Or even doing something in the first place)
  <br><br>
Pushing a little harder in the gym. (Or even going to the gym in the first place)
  <br><br>
Learning/Trying something new. (It is a risk because you are starting yourself at zero when you could, in theory, just continue working on and capitalizing off of things you know)
  <br><br>
A little bit of something is a lot more than nothing.


</p>
<p>
Everything has a price, tradeoff, and opportunity cost; just see which ones seem most honorable or worthy to you; use your brain.
 <br><br>
Although motivation can get you fired up, don’t dive head first into unsustainable tasks or missions. (Unless you want to)
 <br><br>
We are not on earth forever, we are not under 65 forever, we are not under 40 years old forever, we are not under 30 years old forever, we are not in our twenties forever, we are not youth forever, think what it would look like to maximize each stage.
</p>
<p>
Contrary to what may be perceived because of the confidence and bravado I write in, I do not think I am going about things perfectly.
 <br><br>
What I do know is that I am going about things.
 <br><br>
I want to have no regrets about what I did today when I go to bed tonight, no regretting what I did this week when I am eating dinner on Saturday, no regrets about what I did this month on the 31st, no [more] regrets of what I did over the course of my last year on my birthday, no regrets on New Year’s Eve, no regrets when I get my college admissions results, no regrets when I walk into/out of college, you get what I’m saying…
