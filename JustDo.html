Nike’s just do it gets you to get out and do stuff by invoking a sense of drive and ambition.
</p>
<p>
Mine simply just opens your eyes to the fact that there really isn’t too much to lose.
</p>
<p>
Hedging your bet is when you sort of bet on two things instead of one, so you win either way, albeit it is a lesser payout if you do win.
</p>
<p>
When you do anything with the proper mindset, you can look at it like you’re hedging your bet.
</p>
<p>
If you focus on doing something for the sole sake of winning if you lose, you lose everything; if you win, you win everything.
</p>
<p>
But if you go into something thinking, if I win, that’ll be awesome, but the experience and lessons learned along the way are just as spectacular; in the end, you either win objectively, or you will win subjectively.
</p>
<p>
You can either value both the outcome and how far you’ve come or solely focus on the outcome.
</p>
<p>
When you “lose”, no one ever really makes fun of you more than maybe one remark or a little meme about it.
</p>
<p>
When you “win”, the reaction from others typically has a longer life span.
</p>
<p>
If you’ve ever competed, you’re not known as the guy who took 20th place in a 20-person competition, you just say you competed.
</p>
<p>
If you take 3rd in a 20-person competition, you can forever say you took third.
</p>
<p>
Winning last forever; losing dies out pretty fast. It’s just the internal scar of losing that lasts longer, but the only person that can really see that is you.
</p>
<p>
To be honest, no one really cares about what you do unless it affects them.
</p>
<p>
How it can affect them vary.
</p>
<p>
If it makes them feel good/bad about themself, they’ll probably care.
</p>
<p>
If it benefits/hinders them, they’ll probably care.
</p>
<p>
But those cases are the minority.
</p>
<p>
If you try to start a little youtube channel, no one will care unless it does well. That may be unmotivating because no one supports you in the beginning, but hey, at least they're not saying too many bad things about it.
</p>
<p>
But those cases are the minority.
</p>
<p>
If you start writing a little blog, either no one reads it, or people like it. It’s pretty much a win-win. Get better at writing, or have people enjoy it, or even both.
</p>
<p>
You just have to keep in mind the intangible benefits and not always have a set end goal for everything.
</p>
<p>
Make it a goal to just do something just to do it (or just to make it a habit)
</p>
<p>
Goal-oriented is honorable, but at the same time, let’s say due to extenuating circumstances you don’t reach your goals at the time in which you want, At what point does it get toxic?
</p>
<p>
Won’t your brain trick you into thinking you were a failure when it was just simply the fact that you’re a regular human in a regular world?
</p>
<p>
Just work out and see what happens. You will be mad at yourself if you set a goal for a 185lbs bench and don’t hit it as planned.
</p>
<p>
Just focus in school and see what happens. If you set a goal for a 99 avg and don’t get it, you’ll think you’re a failure when your avg was still 5 points higher than before.
</p>
<p>
Goal-Oriented isn’t bad, but Sole Goal Oriented can wear on the edge of toxicity.
</p>
<p>
Just sign up for that competition, go to that club meeting, start that account, just do something and keep doing it; you either get better, get a prize, or improve your character; you’re winning nonetheless.
</p>
<p>
Disclaimer: There are dumb things or things you should not do/prioritize, so use some logic. Don’t drop out and start a tik tok microwave hacks account, or put your (figurative) ladder on the (blatantly obvious) wrong wall.
</p>
<p>
Dude. There are people that prepped for this bodybuilding competition for 4 months, I signed up 3 weeks out and took second. Just do it; what’s there to lose?
</p>
<p>
Dude. I didn’t get a single grade over 80 on any essay in English, and I wrote a book. Just do it; what’s there to lose?
