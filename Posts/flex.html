Although stepping on a stage in front of hundreds of people was not the most fulfilling experience, it certainly was an experience.

<p> I learned many lessons being backstage with people who dedicate just about their entire life to looking a certain way for a specific time for a particular sport to impress particular people, but the lesson I will talk about is what led up to the competition.
                </p>
<p> I will spare you the intricate details of carbs, calories, and cardio that occurred 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2 weeks out, but I will try my best to convey the effort put into it.
                </p>
<p> 
Some of the folks I competed with had signed up in March. Six months out.
                </p>
<p>
Meaning they prepared, ate below their basal metabolic rate, worked out like maniacs, and did stuff they didn’t want to in the process of doing something they did want to do.
                </p>
<p>
Whether you find Bodybuilding to be something of value or not doesn’t matter to them because they find it to be a worthy ‘mission,’ and they deem those who also find it to be this worthy ‘mission’ to be worthy of impressing.
                </p>
<p> 
Everyone is working towards something else. Efforts differ, Intentions differ, and Persons differ; nonetheless, all are working towards something.
                </p>
<p> 
It may seem strange that these people lowered the quality of their life for many weeks for an event (that you may consider vain) that lasts only a few hours with no tangible reward. Still, they may find it strange that you don’t have an intrinsic desire to fulfill your physical potential.
                </p>
<p> 
Something that you deem to be silly to do, someone else can deem silly not to do.
                </p>
<p> 
Some are so passionate about something that the only way you would be able to understand is if you are passionate about the same thing or share the same level of passion about something else.
                </p>
<p> 
Although I stepped on the same stage as these bodybuilders [and beat many of them], I do not share the same scale of passion as them.

                </p>
<p> 
This led me to look at them in confusion initially.

                </p>
<p> 
After seeing how fulfilled and happy just about all of them were, I no longer questioned it.
                </p>
<p> 
I didn’t realize the answer, but I realized that you just don’t question it.
                </p>
<p> 
People are entitled to passions, as tangible/intangible, practical/impractical, rewarding/unrewarding as they may seem; they are nonetheless entitled to valuing them.
                </p>
<p> 
I know some look at me and question why I am so passionate about pivoting to another field if I am already pretty good at one area.
                                 </p>   
<p>
That question, why did I take a gap year if I got into at least one college in the first place?
                </p>
<p> 
There are also some that I have talked to and tried to convey reasoning, but the satisfactory answer they got is that everyone is entitled to their passions that may lead them to take risks you wouldn’t take.
    </p>     
<p> 
There is also another facet to this.
    </p>   
    <p> 
Valuing/Understanding someone’s passion after they have already been rewarded for it.
    </p>   
    <p> 
While I was cutting for my bodybuilding show (I have many other analogies that are more coherent than a bodybuilding show, but I will continue to use this one to convey the aspect of this piece that emphasizes a sort of ‘priority confusion’) I was very low energy, chronically annoyed, but I continued nonetheless. Was it logical? Heck no.
    </p>   
     <p> 
Tired 24/7 to impress people with one Instagram post.
    </p>  
     <p> 
But to me, it was worth it. It was subjectively logical.
    </p>  
     <p> 
I can show this photo to my kids. I can capitalize on this for college or work. Who else can say they beat grown men in a bodybuilding competition at 17?
    </p>  
     <p> 
Very few others that saw me during my time getting ready for it saw any value or reason in it. The only ones that did were the ones that shared a passion for a similar field.
    </p> 
     <p> 
After the show was a different story.
    </p> 
     <p> 
Many messages of congratulations, questions for advice, suggestions, and so on.
    </p> 
    <p> 
This isn’t a sulk story about how I overcame and shut out the haters.
    </p> 
    <p> 
I am simply trying to convey that some things (in this case passions) are not always something to be questioned.
   </p> 
     <p> 
Rather just let peope vibe.
    </p>  
    <p> 
(Disclaimer: If you love someone and you strongly feel that they are putting ‘their ladder on the wrong wall’, then of course, coming from a place of love, try your best to convey what you think to them.)
