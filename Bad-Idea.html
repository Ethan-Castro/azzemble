            <h4>Was it a good idea to venture into an entirely new field, with no oversight/guidance/prior knowledge/backup/clear plan, while delaying your life a year?
</h4>
<p>
The only friend I see is my good friend Hazem, once every other week, and maybe two others that commute to college from home once a month.
</p>
<p>
You may be thinking:
</p>
<p>
Damn, this dude is a loser.
</p>
<p>
or, Damn, this dude seems lonely.
</p>
<p>
I can confidently say I do not feel lonely anymore… I cannot speak on my loser status at this current time.
</p>
<p>
Let me walk you through my usual schedule:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>5 am | Wakeup </li>
<li>5:30 am | Go to Starbucks when they open </li>
<li>5:30–40 am | Chat with the Baristas who have become my friends </li>
<li>5:40 am–12:30 pm | Deep Work Session: Programming Project or Learning </li>
<li>12:30 pm -2:30 pm | Gym </li>
<li>2:30–6 | Finish what I was working on earlier or Start a new course/project for the next morning’s deep work session </li>
<li>6–8 | Jiu Jitsu or continue previous </li>
<li>8–10:30 | Chill with fam</li>
<li>10:30 | Sleep, then restart </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
It’s rare for my schedule to deviate from that.
</p>
<p>
Yes, it’s objectively monotonous, boring, and lacking of anything fun, but it does not feel that way.
</p>
<p>
I’ve grown to love it.
</p>
<p>
What choice do I have other than to love it?
</p>
<p>
To love seeing foreign concepts become native within the same day.
</p>
<p>
To love the feeling of annoyance and anger that nothing is working ->, realizing the worse I feel at the moment of confusion, the more satisfactory grasping it will feel later ->, experiencing that joyous feeling of understanding -> learning to love that mental resistance of immersing myself in the unknown.
</p>
<p>
To love writing on my silly medium account and getting little hearts on my Instagram story.
</p>
<p>
To love seeing progress in the mirror.
</p>
<p>
To love submitting the same guy that made me almost pass out a few weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
To love that my friends behind the Starbucks counter make my drink without me scanning or even saying what I want.
</p>
<p>
I realized the only way not to hate it is to love it.
</p>
<p>
Imagine Sisyphus happy.
</p>
<p>
Luckily, it doesn’t roll back down once I push the boulder up. It’s continuous progress; all I have to do is push.
</p>
<p>
All I have to do is focus, work, learn, and somehow I feel more intelligent and more effective; my chances of getting into an amazing college increase, and my future career earnings/options grow exponentially.
</p>
<p>
The progress is so apparent (to me) that it’s almost as if I am watching myself from an outsider’s perspective.
</p>
<p>
It’s exhilarating to see this kid go from thinking he was going to get into an Ivy League College -> to barely getting into any colleges -> to having no clear path -> choosing to take a gap year -> to now.
</p>
<p>
It feels like a long time, but if I think about it logically for half a second, I realize this is all happening at the speed of light.
</p>
<p>
I will not share everything. I will save it and spread it across a few pieces.
</p>
<p>
In objective + universal metrics, I am a year behind (pushing back college), but I am light years ahead of where I thought I would’ve at 20.
</p>
<p>
Was this a risky decision? Yes.
</p>
<p>
Is this still risky? Yes.
</p>
<p>
Don’t worry. I am still very conscious of the situation.
</p>
<p>
Thank you to everyone who likes the stories of my articles and “Have a great day” stories.
</p>
<p>
Thank you to those who message me about my pieces.
</p>
<p>
Thank you to those who like my coding progress updates.
</p>
<p>
Thank you to those who view my story.
</p>
<p>
Thank you to those who send me resources they think would help me.
</p>
<p>
Thank you to those who allow me to be on my journey without constantly berating me with questions intended to make me feel lesser than for taking this route.
</p>
<p>
Thank you to everyone who doesn’t know what I am doing (or maybe disagrees with it) but still encourages me.
</p>
<p>
Thank you to everyone.
