                <p>
During my sophomore and senior Football seasons, my teammates and I played on a dirt field (picture shown above). We were constantly jamming our toes, twisting our ankles, either getting bruised from being scraped by dry dirt or getting dirty by sliding on wet mud; regardless of the conditions, we still played.                
<br><br> Did we play very well? I wouldn’t say we were atrocious.

<br><br> Did we play as well as our opponents? No (except for this one time).

<br><br> Watching the game as a graduate from the sidelines vs. Playing as a student-athlete on the field was a different experience. However, I was still experiencing the same game nonetheless.

<br><br> I recall: getting yelled at by my coach to follow the play, by my teammate next to me asking me what the play was, and by my parents cheering me on for the play, all while having to wait for the center to snap the ball.

<br><br> The center snapping the ball was then a trigger for me to get past the blocker (left tackle) to either: sack the quarterback, tackle the running back in the backfield, watch for a screen pass, or then have to get past another blocker (running back or full back).

<br><br> There are many things to remember when you’re playing, but when you’re on the sideline, you can chill.

<br><br> When you are a spectator who has never played before, it looks like high school kids playing football. A few skinny kids, a couple of strongish kids, one kid that looks too young to be playing, another that looks like he’s pushing the league age limit.

<br><br> When you are a spectator who has played before, it looks slow, light, uncoordinated, and quite unorganized. But you also know how much sweat, tears, and sacrifice even the worst of teams put into it, so it is quite a strange dilemma.

<br><br> You remember it feeling like life or death, war, a clash of clans, and real.

<br><br> But that’s not what you were watching.

<br><br> You were watching something that only had 5 minutes left in the third quarter, and then you would go home a little early to beat the crowd.

<br><br> You were watching some kids play football, not some gladiators who were put through hellish training to demolish the opposing force in front of their own people.

<br> <br>This wasn’t the Colosseum; this was a turf field.

<br> <br>There weren’t political leaders watching your performance; there were parents and older brothers that were foaming at the mouth to put on some pads.

<br><br> Is this how college kids look at high school kids stressing out over homework and tests?
                    
<br><br> Is this how adults look at college students stressing about their major and the current state of the job market?

<br><br> Is this how employers look at employees stressing over turning in a slide deck on time?

<br> <br>Is this how teachers look at students who are too scared to ask for an extension and instead pull all-nighters?
                    
<br><br> If this is how I look at some, then this is how some …
<br><br>This can’t be. They are not in my shoes. They don’t understand. This IS real. This IS war. This test DOES determine my future. This slidedeck CAN be the reason I’m sleeping on the streets. It IS as bad as it seems, it always is. I HAVE to sweat this, this is big stuff, this ain’t no small stuff.
