Assembling the greatest minds of Gen Z to help LiBerate (Lift up and Build upon each other).

It's Ethan here. 


I created Azzemble to create a platform for Gen Z to share their perspectives, give them a voice, and help them truly uncover their incredible intelligence + creativity + passion.


There aren't many outlets to build upon or share your intellectual thoughts on a platform that isn't dominated by political views or hostile communities.

I want to make it as covenient and easy as possible for you to contribute to the community of Gen Z.</p>
It is inefficient and silly to all keep our perspectives, lessons learned, ideas, tips, advice to ourselves. 
  We can advance, innovate, and iterate so much faster if we work together.

Help me help you, by reading your peers' blogs, by writing your own blogs, by being an active member in the Gen Z community.

Thank you for reading. 

I hope Azzemble is able to provide some value to you.
