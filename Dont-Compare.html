<p>
When we see a bewildering figure that makes us insecure in ourselves, a common cope is
<br><br>
“Although X is better at — — At least I’m not as — — as Y”
<br><br>
Although this works, temporarily, we cannot continue to do this.
<br><br>
This coping strategy naturally puts someone at the bottom of the hierarchy that doesn’t deserve to be there and is only there because of others’ insecurities.
</p>
<p>
Let’s use a fundamental metric, grades.
<br><br>
You get an 80 on a test. Not what you wanted, but not horrible.
<br><br>
Person A gets a 95. This causes you to feel bad about yourself because you do not yet know how to reflect on how you could’ve done better or are not intrinsically confident in your academic ability.
<br><br>
Person C gets a 60. You emotionlessly celebrate. He is inferior to you. Let’s go.
</p>
<p>
My peers convinced me that I left my intelligence in middle school because they treated me as an academic inferior and disguised it as simply just praising me for my strengths (acting as though athletics and academics were mutually exclusive) for a large portion of high school.
<br><br>
Perhaps it was because the environment was more challenging, and others felt they had to push me down to rise.
</p>
<p>
You need to realize that there is no way for you to think lesser of someone without somehow acting indicative of that towards them.
<br><br>
It is practically impossible.
<br><br>
You will always look at them in relation to you. Lesser than, which makes you feel better about yourself. What a horrible way of going about a relationship with another person.
</p>
<p>
Now, look, this has a snowball effect. On top of the disappointment person C feels for failing, he now has all of these eyes that think they’re in a higher position, so in turn, everyone is looking down on him.
<br><br>
Why would person C ever desire to improve?
<br><br>
Your insecurity in yourself is affecting others’ self-perception in a way that can have adverse lifelong effects.
</p>
<p>
You rarely see strong people call someone weak, but rather someone who is only slightly stronger than this ‘weaker person’.
<br><br>
You rarely see an intelligent individual call someone dumb, but someone who is closer to being ‘dumb’ calls someone else dumb.
<br><br>
You rarely see someone practicing martial arts try to start a fight, but rather someone who has fought a little bit or never fought at all try to instigate.
<br><br>
You rarely see a pious individual openly share their disdain for the choices of a rather impious person, but rather it is the person who sins just a little less than the impious person that calls it out.
</p>
<h4>
Being secure in yourself allows others to do so as well.
