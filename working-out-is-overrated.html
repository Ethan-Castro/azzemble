Hello skeptic readers. My name is Ethan Castro.
<br><br>
Here are my credibility markers:
</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Multiple NYS Powerlifting Records Holder</li>
                <li>Competed at the Varsity level in Football, Wrestling, Track & Field</li>
                <li>Does Jiu Jitsu during Leisure time</li>
                <li>Signed Model</li>
<p>
And with all of those being said. I would still be a nerd over jock any day of the year.
<br><br>
Capitalizing on intelligence and being hyper-aware in this society is more beneficial than being a laid-back charismatic chad. There is a balance but for my metrics of success at this time & age, leaning towards nerd is more practical.
<br><br>
These YouTube edits, motivational videos, twitter improvement threads, and self-help resources all overemphasize working out and looking a certain way.


</p>
<p>
The quote
<br><br>
“Sweat more in training, bless less in war”
<br><br>
Is not entirely relevant in the physical sense anymore.
<br><br>
Who the hell are you going to battle with?
<br><br>
When was the last time you fought?
<br><br>
Of course, there is an importance to looking good > feeling good, being able to defend yourself > not having to worry about conflict, being strong > being helpful, being fit > being healthy, but how much more do you need than that?
<br><br>
Where is the emphasis on doing homework, studying, and learning until your brain hurts?
<br><br>
Why is it only curls until the lactic acid in your biceps builds up, pushing you to failure?
<br><br>
Why isn’t it focusing past your comfort zone to increase your neuroplasticity?
<br><br>
I got tricked.
<br><br>
Tricked into being vain, tricked into having a skewed priority structure, tricked into the idea that athletics > academics, how you look > how you are, tricked into thinking how physically strong you are is a measure of how strong you are in general (couldn’t be farther from the truth).
<br><br>
I started my first 14 years of life being gifted solely in academics and cognitive challenges, then that got flipped on its head.
<br><br>
One of my very few regrets in life is working out too much.
<br><br>
Not that I wish I worked out less, but I would do anything to go back and study more, listen more, learn more, focus more, and do homework on time more; if that means having half the gym sessions/practices I had, so be it.
<br><br>
Having gone to the high school I went to, I’ve seen the extremes of working out, studying, and being pressured by parents, so I have a good perspective.
<br><br>
Me being in the position I am in as I write this, I’ll say my biggest regret in high school is that I didn’t work hard enough on what was essential, not just intriguing.
<br><br>
Incoming freshman year, Ethan would not have approved of how I went about my 4 years.
<br><br>
To all of my younger audience reading this who want to be a sTrOnG as me, or as lEaN.
<br><br>
I could’ve been stronger and more athletic while doing better in school. You can do both. Just figure out the point of diminishing returns and don’t go much farther past that. You don’t need to work out twice a day, you don’t need 10 supplements, you don’t need to deadlift 3x a week, you don’t need to cut/bulk every year, you don’t need to do a million sports.
<br><br>
I only wrote this because I wish someone would’ve told me this. Thankfully I’m still young, so it’s not the biggest challenge to shift my mindset.
