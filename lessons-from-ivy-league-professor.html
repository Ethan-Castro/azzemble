<p>
I will keep the names of people and the college anonymous.
</p>
<p>
A close friend of mine and I had spent our Junior to Senior year of High School summer working on our respective projects; although they were separate, we worked together.
</p>
<p>
Traveling 20 stops on the train to Central park to move closer to our end goals.

<br>
</p>
<p>
Fast-forward to the beginning of Senior Year, I had published my book, and he had been semi-established in his field. He was fortunate enough to have an established figure pick up his immaculate Op-Ed and present it in front of a grand audience.
</p>
<p>
Top organizations were flying him out to do guest speeches, spectate different events, provide perspective, and so on.

</p>
<p>
While I was suffering at football practice, he flew around, met famous people, and became pretty well known.
</p>
<p>
<br>
  One day he told me that a school (which we both had at the top of our college list) reached out to him and would like to invite him over to speak with him and share perspectives.


</p>
<p>
To my delight, he invites me as a guest.


</p>
<p>
Two confident young teens of color, identifying strongly with their intellectual side, get on a train and head to the college.


</p>
<p>
Along the way, we do what any young men on somewhat of an upward curve do. We come up with bodacious & elaborate plans & predictions for the future.


</p>
<p>
  <i>When they talk to us, they have to admit us.</i>
<br><br>
<i> Who else is doing this, bro?</i>

</p>
<p>
  <i>We are one of a kind.</i> (Fastforward, and we are one of the kinds that get rejected from the school. I’ll save that for a future piece)


</p>
<p>
<br>
  We get there.

</p>
<p>
We talk with the faculty, the pretentious students, and the down-to-earth students that chill in the corner.

</p>
<p>
They were impressed, but that’s beside the point.

</p>
<p>
We noticed that everyone was quite strange, but not strange to each other.


</p>
<p>
They were different, but not different from one another.
</p>
<p>
They were in a bubble. (I’ll speak more on that in another piece)
</p>
<p>
We talk about ourselves and ideas, and they speak about their little academic drama and how <i>Classics MUST teach Latin.</i> And how <i>not teaching Latin is a DISSERVICE to all of humanity. How will they be able to learn?</i>


</p>
<p>
<br>
  Fast forward a few hours, and we are having dinner at a professor’s house.

</p>
<p>
Their hair is down (figuratively), and we hear some pretty outlandish things.

</p>
<p>
With a mix of an experience that convinced us that we were practically admitted and going behind the curtain, we were almost dissuaded from wanting to go.

</p>
<p>
<br>
  You realize it’s all a facade.
</p>    
<p>
<i>These professors aren’t geniuses; they’re just smart & just dedicated their lives to a field. </i>(Over exaggeration for some of them are geniuses, but it’s to say they’re not special)
</p>
<p>
<i>These students are brilliant but not all good. They live in a bubble that is almost impossible to escape from. They are building their intelligence seemingly infinitely but have no intentions of ever doing anything with it.
  </i>
              </p>
<p>
During our time at dinner in the professor’s house, we thought:

</p>
<p>
  <i>Is it this easy?</i>
  <br>
  <i>This can easily be me.</i>
  <br>
  <i>Is everyone, even the most intelligent and most established figures, like this behind closed doors?</i>
</p>
<p>
It was indeed an experience.
</p>
<p>
<br>
  There are many different worlds out there.
</p> 
<p>
There are many we have experienced, many we have yet to experience, and many we will never experience.
</p>
<p>
Getting a glimpse into this world changed my outlook on my world.
</p>
<p>
I had held this world to the highest standard. It was mystical, mysterious, and magnificent. It was greater than anything else to me.
</p>
<p>
So you can imagine how seismically perspective shifting it would be, for it just to be another world.
</p>
<p>
(I’m lowkey lying. I’m still doing everything I can to get admitted into that world. I will speak more on this seeming disappointment by-> still wanting to be accepted by phenomena in another piece.)
</p>
<p>
Cheers!
</p>
<p>
I hope you are all doing well.
